First Paragraph
===============

First Paragraph provides a field formatter for body-style fields which allows
only the first paragraph of text.

The core 'trim' functionality can lead to unpredictable teasers and truncated
text. This module allows editorial users to know that whatever they set as their
first paragraph, that is what will come out on the teaser listing.

This also avoids editors having to split the body into two fields.
